# Pernalonga [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/fellipebrito/pernalonga/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fellipebrito/pernalonga) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/fellipebrito/pernalonga/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/fellipebrito/pernalonga/coverage)

Pernalonga is a simple wrapper for the Ruby gem Bunny. While Bunny has all classes and methods for utilizing an AMQP queuing system, the code for doing so can take up a lot of space and tends to be repeated across many projects.

## Usage
Pernalonga sets up the logic of publishing and subscribing to queues and processing messages.

### Connection Configuration
Your connection configurations must be environment variables.

Pernalonga uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to autoload any information you have in a .env file.

A sample .env file would contain the following required variables.
```
BUNNY_USER=abc
BUNNY_VHOST=abc
BUNNY_PASSWORD=abc
BUNNY_HOST=abc
```

### Consuming
You donâ€™t have to setup all the Bunny objects for Connections, Channels and Queues and arrange your message processing logic within them.

Instead, the only required thing is to simply implement a `process_message` method in your class. This way, once you call `Pernalonga.consume self, "queue_name"` to process messages from a queue, Pernalonga will call back your `process_message` method passing the message as the unique parameter.

### Enqueuing
To enqueue messages
 just use `Pernalonga.enqueue "queue_name" message`.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pernalonga'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pernalonga

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
